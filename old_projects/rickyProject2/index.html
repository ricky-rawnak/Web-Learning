    <h2 class="headname1">1.Great Wall of China </h2>
    <p class="details1">The Great Wall of China is called “万里长城” in simplified characters or “萬里長城” in traditional
        characters;<br>
        <br> It means “10000-li(half kilometer) long wall”
        Of course people also simply call it “长(長) 城”, which literally means “long wall</p>
    <h3 class="headname2">2.Christ the Redeemer Statue</h3>
    <div class="details2">The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over the Brazilians from upon
        Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of eternal blessing since 1931.
        <br> The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost
        approximately $250,000 to build - much of the money was raised through donations.
        <br> The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil</div>
    <h4 class="headname3">3.Taj Mahal</h4>
    <p class="details3">This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments
        and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture.
        It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
        Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child.
        It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a
        reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and
        floral patterns.
        Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes.
        According to some reports, Shah Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of black marble.<br>
        However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.</p>
    <h5 class="headname1">Machu Picchu</h5>
    <div class="details1">4.Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched between 2 towering
        Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of
        Cusco.<br>
        Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the
        Incas.<br>
        The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram
        Bingham.<br>
        The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</div>
    <h6 class="headname2">5.Chichen Itza </h6>
    <div class="details2">6.The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid ruins of Chichen
        Itza.
        This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt,
        flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as the political and economic hub of the Mayan
        civilization.
        The most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical observatory.</div>
