    <p class="abc">International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) is one of the top graded Government approved private universities in Bangladesh.
        The credit for the idea of establishing this University goes to Islamic University Chittagong Trust (IUCT),
         which is the founder organization of the University. This Trust is a non-political and non-profit oriented voluntary organization, registered with the Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh under the Societies Act XXI of 1860. This Trust felt the need for a university under private initiative in view of the absence of institutions of higher learning based on Islamic vision of life in the public sector. With this idea having its origin in 1990, the Trust discussed the concept of a private Islamic university with a group of intellectuals, Islamic thinkers, and educationists, from home and abroad.
          It was these Islamic personalities that came forward to materialize the dream of such an institution by putting their ideas, energies and fulfilling other requirements.</p>
